    "## Random Variables\n",
    "A __random variable__ is defined as a variable whose values depend on outcomes of random events. For example, when we carry out an experiment, we never get exactly the same result twice, maybe due to some measurement errors or some flaws in the system we are using to measure. But what is __randomness__? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some argue that this variation is not random and simply due to high-complexity processes that we are in no place of following accurately. For example, Robert Brown, a famous physicist, saw that pollen particles in water seem to bounce around randomly by bouncing about the water molecules. Some would argue that this was not random, and that if we knew where __all__ water molecules were and where they were going at all times, we could predict exactly where they would be later on. However, this is impossible to do in practice, and there was far more success when treating these as random forces!\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we generate a random value? We can use in-built functions, such as the ones from the __random__ and __numpy__ modules to generate random values. Numpy comes with the added functionality of creating vectors and matrices of random values in one line."

    "An __experiment__ is a process whose outcome is uncertain, with all possible outcomes being its __sample space__. So in __descriptive statistics__, when we want measure a quantity, we can treat the quantity as a random variable. For example, let us consider the length of foxes in the UK. We know that there are scientific justfications for different foxes having different lengths, but if we treat fox height as a random variable and consider all differences to be random, we can extract very useful information, such as __how much the population varies, what is the most frequent height or what value is the most representative of this population__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __population__ is described as a well-defined collection of objects we are interested in and a __sample__ is a subset of this population that we can get data from. We normally only have access to information from a sample of an entire population, and we use this data to estimate the properties of the population itself. Some of the simplest properties, are given in the equations below:\n",

These are __estimates__ of the population mean($\\mu$), standard deviation($\\sigma$) and variance($\\sigma^{2}$). The population mean, also known as __expected value__, is the value that is the most representative of the population. Another way to look at it is that given the sample size of n, __the expected value is the unique value that if you add it to itself n times, it is the same as the sum of all your samples__. By analysing the variance equation, we can see that the variance is the expected value of the square of the difference between the samples and the mean. Intuitively, this means that variace is a measure of the spread of the data. \n",

What if I ask you, given these quantities, what is more likely: to find a fox with a length of 65 centimetres or one with the length of 5 metres? I think most people would agree that 65cm is far more likely, since it's closer than the other option to the sample mean and the variance of the population isn't large enough to lead to such large difference in length! \n",

    "##  Introduction to Probability\n",
    "__Probability__ is a measure of how likely an outcome is to occur given all other possible outcomes and the given circumstances. Therefore, when dealing with random variables, we do not concern ourselves with __what will happen__, but instead with __the probability of given outcome(s), also known as events, occuring__. Probability is formally defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Probability of an outcome} = \\frac{\\text{Number of wanted outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we know that the probability of something occurring has to be somewhere between 0, where the outcome _cannot_ occur, and 1, where the outcome _will_ occur. Given the events A and B, we can also define $P(A\\cup B)$ as the probability of ___either___ A or B taking place and $P(A\\cap B)$ as the probability of ___both___ A and B taking place. In terms of digital logic, __union__( $\\cap$ ) corresponds to the __or__ operator and __intersection__( $\\cup$ ) to the __and__ operator. Using these, we can define key properties of probability theory: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$1. P(A) = 1-P(A') $$\n",
    "$$2. \\sum_{i=1}^{N}P(A_{i}) = 1$$\n",
    "$$3. P(A\\cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\\cup B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A' is the __complement__ of A, and represents all events that are not included in A. The complement behaves like the __not__ operator, meaning the first property implies that the probability of an event taking place is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event __NOT__ taking place. If the probability of raining tomorrow is 0.8, then the probability that it will NOT rain tomorrow is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. The second property implies that the sum of the probability of any of the possible events must equal to 1. This makes sense, since out of all possible outcomes, at least one must take place. For example, there is a probability of 1 that it will either rain or not that it will not rain tomorrow, and there is a probability of 1 that the length of a fox we find in the wild will be between 0 and infinity! The third property shows that the probability of events A or B occuring is given by the sum of the probability of A with the probability of B, subtracted by the probability of both events taking place. This is because the by adding the two individual probabilities, the intersection between them is accounted for twice.\n",
