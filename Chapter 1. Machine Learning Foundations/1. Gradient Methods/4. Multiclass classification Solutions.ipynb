    "\n",
    "Either the example falls into this class, or it doesn't. We have seen that we can represent this by our model having a single output node whose value is forced between 0 and 1, and as such represents probability that the example belongs to the positive class.\n",

    "In the case where we have two nodes to represent true and false, we can think about it as having trained two separate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating true and false as separate classes with separate output nodes shows us how we can extend this idea to do multiclass classification; we simply add more nodes and ensure that their values are positive and sum to one.\n",

    "### Properties of softmax\n",
    "\n",

    "- an increase in one input element increases it's corresponding output element exponentially whilst pushing others down, \n",
    "- this means that __it is very easy for the one largest output element to become dominant__\n",

    "\n",
    "### What does the name \"softmax\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- as explained above, usually one input is near `1`, and all others close to `0`. That is, similar to the `argmax` operation mentioned previously but \"soft\" as it can be differentiated.\n",
    "- `argmax` changes abruptly, small difference between two values make it either `0` or `1`. Softmax on the other hand changes gradually when the maximum changes\n",
