    "## Functional vs. Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "- Most programming you have done up to now is functional\n",
    "- In simple terms, this is putting inputs into a function, getting an output and then using that output as the input to another function\n",
    "- In many cases in data science this approach is not optimal, and instead it is better to group data and its related functions together in what we call a 'class'\n",
    "- A class is a collection of 'data' which we call attributes, and 'operations' (basically functions) which we call methods\n",
    "- This means we can much more easily handle doing tasks repeatedly for similar types of data, in the same way that we use loops/functions etc\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To understand this idea, it is best to use an example:<br>\n",
    "Imagine you owned a shop, and wanted an easy way to keep stock of everything you have in it. <br>\n",
    "You could create a StockItem class, with details of the items such as the name of the item, how many you have in stock, the price of each item, which section the item is in etc.<br>\n",
    "You could also have operations that the items could 'do', e.g. take delivery, sell an item, change its price etc\n",
    "- The 'details' of the item e.g. name/stock level/price would be ATTRIBUTES\n",
    "- The 'operations' of the item e.g. change stock level/change price would be METHODS\n",
    "- Each item would be an OBJECT or INSTANCE\n",
    "- The general blueprint of an item would be a CLASS"
